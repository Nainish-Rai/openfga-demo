# Implementation Plan for Compliance Authorization System with MongoDB and OpenFGA

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step instructions for implementing a compliance authorization system using MongoDB and OpenFGA. The goal is to provide a clear and concise guide that developers can follow to set up and integrate these technologies efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (version 4.0 or later)
- [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) (latest version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Copilot extension

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB
1. **Download and Install MongoDB**:
   - Follow the instructions on the official [MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

2. **Create a Database**:
   - Open your MongoDB shell or GUI tool (like MongoDB Compass).
   - Create a new database named `compliance_auth`.

### Step 2: Set Up OpenFGA
1. **Install OpenFGA**:
   - Follow the installation guide on the [OpenFGA documentation](https://openfga.dev/docs/installation).

2. **Configure OpenFGA**:
   - Define your data model in OpenFGA. An example model might look like:
     ```json
     {
       "type": "Model",
       "attributes": {
         "resource": "string",
         "action": "string"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Use the OpenFGA CLI to apply this model.

### Step 3: Integrate MongoDB with OpenFGA
1. **Create a Node.js Project**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install MongoDB and OpenFGA SDKs:
     ```bash
     npm install mongodb openfga
     ```

3. **Set Up Database Connection**:
   - Create a `db.js` file to manage MongoDB connection:
     ```javascript
     const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
     const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
     const client = new MongoClient(uri);
     
     async function connectDB() {
       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
     }
     
     module.exports = { connectDB };
     ```

### Step 4: Implement Authorization Logic
1. **Create Authorization Functions**:
   - In your main application file (e.g., `app.js`), implement functions to handle authorization logic using OpenFGA.

2. **Connect to MongoDB and OpenFGA**:
   - Use the functions from `db.js` to connect to MongoDB and query data as needed for authorization.

### Step 5: Testing
1. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Use a testing framework like Jest to create unit tests for your authorization functions.
   - Ensure that your tests cover various scenarios to validate the authorization logic.

2. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute your tests and verify that they pass successfully:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

### Step 6: Optimize with VS Code Copilot
1. **Use Copilot for Code Suggestions**:
   - As you write your code in VS Code, leverage the Copilot extension to get real-time suggestions.
   - Review and accept suggestions that align with your implementation plan.

2. **Refactor Code**:
   - Use Copilot to help refactor and improve your code quality as you go.

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building a compliance authorization system with MongoDB and OpenFGA. By following these steps, you can efficiently set up and optimize your development process using VS Code Copilot.
